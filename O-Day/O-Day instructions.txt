Tank:
Connect the battery to the 2 pins on the back right side of the tank. (Positive on the outside)
Battery voltage should be between 8.4V and 6.4V, don't let it discharge past there!
All the other connections should be already connected.
Flick the switch on the back of the tank (Down - on, Up - off)
The circuit board is not properly attached to the tank so if it comes off, you might need to tape / blu tack it back in
The tank tracks might slip off the wheels, if that happens just put them back on. You don't need to take off the wheels to do so

Controller:
Have the ESP8266 plugged into your PC's USB port
Open the ControllerPC.sln solution and run it.
Or go into ControllerPC/bin/Release/net6.0 and run the ControllerPC.exe
Once the program opens, click Connect if it is not connected already
Click the WASD control button and then use WASD to control the tank

Battery Charging:
Select LiPo BALANCE CHG 0.8A 7.4V(2S)
Hold START button to start.
Press stop to stop.
Charge before the batteries discharge to 6.4V, they should be 8.4V fully charged
