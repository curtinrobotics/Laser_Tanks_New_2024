## Overview
This is the 4th version of the Laser Tank model. It aims to address issues in the V3 model such as
- The screw holes being slightly too small
- The axle holes being slightly too small
- The driver wheel being too close to the idler wheel
- The accidental shallow screw inset holes in the front track holder
- The holder for the switch and two LEDs being too thin
- The corner of the front track holders needing to be clipped to fit properly

A big change made in V4 is the back tracks not being adjustable anymore. Instead, the tracks were modelled and measured. The required length of tracks was found to be roughy 356 mm
